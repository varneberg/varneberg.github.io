1. What is the definition of software security?
   * When a program functions according to the intentions in an adverserial enviroment

2. What does software security logic consist of? And what are some examples of these?
   * Requirements
     * Capture the intentions of the software

      * Terminates if modification is detected
    * W^X
      * OS enforcing writeable memory cannot be executed
      * Prevents loading shell in writeable buffers
    * Address space layout randomisation
      * Randomising the layout when allocating memory in the system
      * Makes the attacker guess the locations of functions and libraries

12. What are some of the best practises to avoid buffer overflow?

    * Use the compiler to find vulnerabilities
    * Run static analysis to identify bugs
  
13. What is memory safety?
    * Each part of the program is only given access to the memory locations they are permitted
